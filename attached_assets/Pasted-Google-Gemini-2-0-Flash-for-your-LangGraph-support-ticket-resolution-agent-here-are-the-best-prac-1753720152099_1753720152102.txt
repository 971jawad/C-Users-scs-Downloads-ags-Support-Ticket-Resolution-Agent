Google Gemini (2.0 Flash) for your LangGraph support ticket resolution agent, here are the best practices tailored to this use case and architecture.

✅ BEST PRACTICES FOR LANGGRAPH + GEMINI 2.0 FLASH


---

🔁 1. Design Your Graph with Clear, Named Nodes

Each step in the graph should have a clear purpose and named node function:

classify_ticket_node

retrieve_context_node

generate_response_node

review_response_node

refine_context_node

escalate_node


🔧 Best Practice:

Use @tool, @node, or modular classes to isolate logic per node.

Make each node stateless but context-aware (pass state via LangGraph edges).



---

📦 2. Structure Shared Memory Thoughtfully

Gemini handles 1M+ token context, but don’t rely on that blindly.

📌 Use a central LangGraph state object to store:

{
  "ticket": { "subject": ..., "description": ... },
  "category": "Billing",
  "retrieved_context": [...],
  "drafts": [...],
  "review_feedback": [...],
  "final_output": "...",
  "retries": 1,
}

🧠 Tip:

Keep tokens under control: store only what's necessary.

For retries, store feedback and retrieved context separately.



---

🔍 3. Classification with Gemini — Use Few-shot Prompting

Gemini Flash doesn't support fine-tuning yet, so use smart prompting.

📄 Prompt pattern:

Classify this ticket into one of: Billing, Technical, Security, General.

Ticket:
Subject: Login failed
Description: I keep getting a 401 error after updating the app.

Answer: [Category]

✅ Use examples if Gemini is being inconsistent.


---

📚 4. Category-Aware Retrieval (RAG)

Use separate knowledge bases per category if possible (static JSON or FAISS). If not, filter context based on category using keyword filters.

📌 Example:

if category == "Billing":
    docs = billing_vectorstore.similarity_search(query)
elif category == "Security":
    docs = security_docs[:3]

🧠 Embed the ticket subject + description as query, not just raw string.


---

✍️ 5. Drafting with Structured Prompts

Use clean, consistent prompt templates:

You are a support agent. Based on the issue and internal documentation, write a helpful, polite reply.

Ticket:
{ticket.subject}
{ticket.description}

Relevant Information:
{retrieved_context}

Write your reply below:

✅ Include category-specific tone/policy cues if needed.


---

✅ 6. LLM-Based Review Policy

Gemini Flash can also review responses. Give it clear review criteria:

Review this support reply.

Guidelines:
- Do not overpromise or offer refunds.
- Stay polite.
- Avoid security advice unless from docs.

Response:
{draft_response}

Does this comply? Answer YES or NO. If NO, explain what needs improvement.

✅ Structure the output to easily parse with regex or JSON.


---

🔁 7. Retry Logic (Max 2 Attempts)

Use a counter in LangGraph state:

if state["retries"] < 2 and not review_passed:
    state["retries"] += 1
    return "retry"
else:
    return "escalate"

✅ Feed back reviewer suggestions to the context refinement or retrieval step.


---

📤 8. Escalation & Logging

On failure after 2 attempts:

Save ticket, all drafts, and review feedback to escalation_log.csv

Format as:


ticket_id,subject,description,draft_1,review_1,draft_2,review_2

✅ Make this modular (log_escalation() function) for reusability.


---

🔒 9. Handle Gemini Limits Gracefully

Add retry logic for Gemini API failures (rate limits, errors)

Add latency indicators/logging to trace model response time

Keep each call below ~50K output tokens (safe limit)



---

🧰 10. Tooling, Testing, and Debugging

✅ Use LangGraph CLI for local dev

✅ Use LangGraph tracing for state transitions

✅ Unit test each node independently with mock inputs

✅ Log key steps to stdout or use rich/loguru for clarity



---

🧠 Optional Enhancements

🤖 Use langchain.retrievers.MultiQueryRetriever to handle vague tickets.

📝 Add Markdown formatting to draft replies.

🧪 Use a Test Harness script with sample tickets to simulate multiple flows.

📊 Output success/failure summary after each run.

✅ Summary of Best Practices for Gemini + LangGraph

Layer	Best Practice

Prompt Engineering	Clear templates, few-shot for classification
RAG	Category-specific routing or filtering
Retry Loop	Use LangGraph state, feedback-guided fetch
Review Node	Explicit policy checks, structured output
LLM Usage (Gemini)	Keep input/output lean, use structured memory
Escalation	Log with all attempts + feedback
Architecture	Modular LangGraph nodes with traceability
