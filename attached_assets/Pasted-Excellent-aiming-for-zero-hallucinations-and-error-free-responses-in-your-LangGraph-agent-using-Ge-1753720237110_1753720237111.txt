Excellent — aiming for zero hallucinations and error-free responses in your LangGraph agent using Gemini 2.0 Flash is smart, especially for a support system.

Here’s a focused anti-hallucination best practices checklist, plus techniques to minimize LLM errors in each LangGraph node:


---

🧱 1. Foundational Principles

Principle	Actionable Practice

Grounding	Always give the LLM explicit, relevant context (RAG, structured prompts).
Constraint	Make the prompt instruct the LLM not to invent answers or go beyond the data.
Verification	Use an LLM reviewer to detect hallucinations.
Fallback	Escalate unclear/conflicting outputs. Never auto-respond on low-confidence.

🔁 Each LangGraph Node — Hallucination Defense Plan

✅ 1. Classification Node

Prompt Format:

Classify the ticket into one of: [Billing, Technical, Security, General].
Respond with a single category. Do not guess. Respond with 'Unknown' if unsure.

✅ Best Practice:

Add a validation layer to check that output is exactly one of the predefined categories.

Fallback to General or Escalate if Unknown.




---

✅ 2. RAG Node (Context Retrieval)

✅ Use high-quality, category-specific sources.

✅ Set a retrieval limit (e.g., top 3 chunks) to avoid irrelevant noise.

✅ Filter results post-retrieval:

Remove snippets without category match or required keywords.



🔐 Anti-Hallucination Tip:

Include in prompt:

Only use the provided context. Do not add information that is not explicitly stated.



---

✅ 3. Draft Generator Node

🔒 Add strict grounding instructions:

Your response must be strictly based on the context below. Do not assume or infer beyond it.
If the answer is unclear, say: "I will forward this to a human support agent."

🧠 If context is weak, fallback:

Trigger escalation before generating a possibly hallucinated draft.




---

✅ 4. Reviewer Node

This is your quality gate — make it strict.


🎯 Prompt:

Review this response based on the context provided.
- ✅ Approve if the reply is accurate, helpful, and matches the context exactly.
- ❌ Reject if it:
  - Makes assumptions not found in the context
  - Offers unverified refunds, discounts, or security advice
  - Sounds vague or off-topic

Respond as JSON:
{
  "approved": true | false,
  "feedback": "Explain why"
}

✅ Ensure Gemini is in review mode: frame it as a strict policy checker, not a creative agent.



---

✅ 5. Retry Node

On rejection, revise only based on reviewer feedback and re-retrieved RAG context.

Add check to avoid retry if RAG still fails to improve.



---

✅ 6. Escalation Node

Fallback is always preferred over guessing.

Message:

I'm escalating this ticket to a human support agent to ensure accurate handling. Thank you for your patience.



---

📊 Logging for Debugging Hallucinations

Log the following in your LangGraph state or output file:

Final draft + reviewer feedback

Retrieved context chunks used

Flags like hallucination_risk: true if reviewer found one


✅ Use this data for manual inspection or further model finetuning later.


---

🧪 Testing: Build a Hallucination Trap Suite

Include sample tickets designed to bait hallucinations, e.g.:

“Can I get a refund for 2 months downtime?”

“Where’s the Bitcoin address I can send to?”

“Please explain your internal firewall rules.”


Test your pipeline's ability to reject, escalate, or politely decline those.

✅ Summary of No-Hallucination Strategy

Layer	Key Strategy

Prompts	Use grounding instructions everywhere
RAG	Keep it narrow, relevant, and limited
Review Loop	Make reviewer harsh and explicit
Retry Control	Avoid retry if no context improvement
Escalation Logic	Default to escalate if confidence is low
Logging	Store all drafts, contexts, and review results
