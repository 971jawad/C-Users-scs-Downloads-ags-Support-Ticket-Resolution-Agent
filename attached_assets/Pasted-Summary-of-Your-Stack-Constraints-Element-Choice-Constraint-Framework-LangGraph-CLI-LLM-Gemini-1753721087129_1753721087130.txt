Summary of Your Stack & Constraints

Element	Choice / Constraint

Framework	LangGraph CLI
LLM	Gemini Flash 2.0 via Gemini CLI
Retrieval	RAG (FAISS + local embeddings)
Environment	Docker Desktop, optional PowerShell
Model constraints	Must avoid hallucination, be fast, free
Task complexity	Multi-step graph: classify → retrieve → generate → review → retry loop (max 2)

🔑 Best Practices per Component


---

1. 🚀 LangGraph Node Design

Design each step as a modular LangGraph node. Keep each function:

Small (single responsibility)

Traceable (log inputs/outputs)

Re-entrant (able to retry cleanly)


Node Name	Best Practice

ticket_input	Validate schema (subject + description)
classify_node	Use Gemini Flash with very clear label list
retrieve_context	Query per-category vector store (e.g. technical.faiss)
draft_response	Prompt Gemini with: ticket + top 3 docs
review_response	Use structured prompt checklist (avoid vague feedback)
retry_loop	Log rejection reasons; max 2 tries
escalate_case	CSV log with full trace (ticket + drafts + feedback)



---

2. 🧠 Prompt Engineering

Gemini Flash 2.0 is fast but can hallucinate if not guided clearly. Best practices:

Use This	Avoid This

✅ System prompt with role: “You are a support QA reviewer.”	❌ Open-ended creative prompts
✅ Provide strict options (e.g., “Choose one: Billing, Technical…”)	❌ Asking LLM to "guess" from vague data
✅ Ask Yes/No + explanation during review	❌ Ask “Is this good?”


Example (Classification):

Classify this support ticket into one of the following:
Billing, Technical, Security, General

Subject: Login failure on mobile
Description: I can't log into the app since updating my phone

Answer (label only):


---

3. 📚 RAG Best Practices (Context Retrieval)

Use category-specific indexes: billing_index, tech_index, etc.

Limit retrieval to top 3 documents

Use dense embeddings like:

all-MiniLM-L6-v2

gte-small

bge-small-en-v1.5 (strong + free)


Make the retrieval query dynamic:

query = f"{ticket['subject']} {ticket['description']}"

Always include retrieved docs in prompt to Gemini:

Use the following context to answer:
[doc1]
[doc2]
...



---

4. 🔁 Review Loop & Retry Strategy

Rule	Best Practice

Max retries	✅ 2 max attempts
Feedback	✅ Let reviewer give specific failure reason
Retry logic	✅ Use reviewer feedback to refine query
Loop control	✅ Implement a counter inside LangGraph node


Review Checklist Prompt:

Evaluate this support response:

1. Is it accurate based on context?
2. Does it violate policy? (e.g., refund promises, security advice)
3. Is it clear and helpful?

Response:
[Insert response]

Answer YES/NO for each, then feedback:


---

5. 🧱 Docker Setup Best Practices

Pin Python version (python:3.11-slim)

Install dependencies via requirements.txt

Mount .gemini config if using Gemini CLI

Expose CLI port if needed for debugging (EXPOSE 8000)


Example command:

docker run -it -v ~/.gemini:/root/.gemini langgraph-agent


---

6. 🛠️ LangGraph CLI Usage Tips

Use Case	Best Practice

Local dev	Use langgraph dev start inside Docker
Testing	Keep each LangGraph node testable via unit test
Debugging	Use print logs or trace logging in each node
CLI scripts	You can script test cases via PowerShell too



---

7. 📁 Escalation Handling (Optional)

If response fails after 2 attempts:

Write to escalation_log.csv:

Ticket subject

Description

All draft attempts

Reviewer feedback


Notify in final output: “Escalated to human agent.”



---

8. 🧪 Testing Coverage

Test for:

Scenario	Expected

✅ Happy path (review passes first try)	Response returned
✅ Retry path (review fails once)	Re-draft works
✅ Retry fails twice	Escalation triggered
✅ Classification edge case	Correct fallback
❌ No docs retrieved	Graceful error
❌ Invalid ticket format	Caught early



---

9. 🔐 Avoid Hallucinations

Strategy	Reason

✅ Use Gemini Flash only on short, grounded tasks	Less prone to drift
✅ Feed relevant docs directly into prompt	Avoids model guessing
✅ Never let LLM “create policy”	Reviewer should check, not invent rules
✅ Use structured outputs when possible	"Label only", "Yes/No", etc.



---

✅ Final Checklist Before Demo

✅ Modular LangGraph nodes
✅ Clean RAG stack (per-category FAISS)
✅ Gemini prompts structured and safe
✅ Retry logic tested (with feedback loop)
✅ Escalation via CSV
✅ CLI tested via Docker + PowerShell
✅ README + code + demo ready
